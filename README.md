This project serves as a learning experience for procedural generation and on-click actions in Godot.
Open the folder in Godot and run a scene of your choice (command/control + Shift+ R) 

Scenes 1
World.tscn  

Actions: Press E to enter "Dirt Mode" to place soil on tillable tiles. Press R to enter "Seed Mode" to plant seeds on tilled soil. Seeds will grow in 5 second intervals

Scene 2 
Proc_gen_world

This Scene serves more as a tool than a game. Navigate to the FileSystem menu in the bottom left corner of Godot, select the Scenes folder, and double-click proc_gen_world.tscn.
Next Select the proc_gen_world node by clicking it in the top left corner in the Scene tab of Godot, followed by navigating to right-side navigation menu, in the Noise Texture option, left-click the "NoiseText" button to enter the settings for
this tool. 

Navigate to the Noise setting within this sub-menu and left-click the "Fast Noise" button, you should see a grey and white image appear with more options. 
Adjust the Seed and Frequency Values and then run the Proc_gen_world.tscn Scene file to observe your changes. Adjust the values again to see different results.  (other values can also be adjusted for varying effects)
